2.	Data cleaning
Data cleaning was started by standardizing decimal numbers into 2 decimal numbers for rating column, checking for duplicate and missing values, and understanding dataset information.
3.	Feature relationship
Observed the correlation between features. Changed the data type into numbers to create the correlation table and heatmap. Creating heatmap using seaborn library
4.	Ask questions about the data
Doing an exploratory analysis of the data by asking questions. The first question was author with the most books. Got the answer by groupby and sort_values. The result was visualized with bar chart.
